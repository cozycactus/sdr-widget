Last updated: 2026-06-07

This repo is the legacy SDR Widget firmware tree. The original firmware targets
an AVR32 AT32UC3A3256; the currently connected bring-up board is an Atmel
SAME70 Xplained board with an ATSAME70Q21 Cortex-M7 MCU. Keep the AVR32 build
and the SAME70 port separate unless the user explicitly asks to merge paths.

## Maintenance

- Update this file when the verified board state, build/flash commands, serial
  port, or next bring-up milestone changes.
- Keep updates factual and short. Prefer measured or observed results over
  guesses.
- Do not revert unrelated dirty files or generated build output unless the user
  asks.

## Current Board State

The active hardware is the SAME70 Xplained board connected over the EDBG USB
interface. OpenOCD detects it with CMSIS-DAP/SWD as `atsame70q21`.

The SAME70 proof-of-life port lives in:

```sh
ports/same70-xplained
```

Verified firmware features:

- Green user LED heartbeat on PC8, active-low.
- EDBG virtual COM status console on USART1 at 9600 8N1.
- USART1 RX is interrupt-driven with a small software ring buffer.
- Main clock is the external 12 MHz crystal with PLLA at 300 MHz CPU and
  150 MHz MCK; UPLL is enabled for USBHS.
- Cortex-M SysTick is enabled at 1 kHz.
- USBHS target-port device mode enumerates at high speed as
  `16c0:05dc Yoyodyne SDR-Widget`, serial `1.0.0.0.0.0.0`.
- USB endpoint 0 exposes the UAC1 SDR Widget composite descriptor: interface 0
  is DG8SAQ/vendor control, interfaces 1-3 are USB Audio Control/Streaming.
- macOS lists `Yoyodyne SDR-Widget` as a USB audio device with 2 input
  channels, 2 output channels, and 48 kHz current sample rate.
- Endpoint 0 handles standard enumeration, interface alternate-setting
  requests, SDR Widget vendor feature requests, and basic UAC1 mute/volume and
  sample-rate control requests.
- `widget-control -a`, `-d`, `-g`, `-m`, `-l`, and `-r` have been verified
  against the connected SAME70 board. `-r` now performs a real software reset;
  the device re-enumerates afterward and `-d` still returns defaults.
- After macOS audio enumeration and `widget-control -d`, the serial `usb`
  command has been verified with `stall=0`.
- Feature "NVRAM" on the SAME70 port is currently a volatile RAM
  compatibility table, not persistent SAME70 flash storage.
- Audio streaming endpoints are descriptor-visible only; endpoint 3 OUT,
  endpoint 4 feedback IN, and endpoint 5 audio IN are not yet configured for
  real isochronous traffic.
- Console commands: `?`, `help`, `status`, `usb`, `usb init`, `usb attach`,
  `usb detach`.

Known SAME70/board quirks:

- EDBG VCOM uses PA21/RXD1 and PB4/TXD1.
- PB4 resets as JTAG `TDI`; set `MATRIX_CCFG_SYSIO.SYSIO4` before muxing PB4
  to peripheral D for TXD1.
- The proven macOS serial device in this setup is `/dev/cu.usbmodem1462302`.
- USB enumeration requires a second cable on the SAME70 target USB connector;
  the EDBG/debug USB connector only provides SWD and the serial console.

## Commands

Build:

```sh
make -C ports/same70-xplained
```

Probe:

```sh
make -C ports/same70-xplained probe
```

Flash connected SAME70 board:

```sh
make -C ports/same70-xplained flash
```

Open the serial console:

```sh
screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1462302 9600
```

Verified `status` output shape:

```text
status tick=<n> uptime_ms=<n> us_csr=0x00f00000
```

Verified `usb init` output shape:

```text
usb init=1 attached=1
pmc_sr=0x0103ff4b pmc_usb=0x00000901 pcsr1=0x00000004
ctrl=0x02008000 sr=0x00005c03 devctrl=0x0000009d
events reset=1 setup=<n> tx=<n> rxout=<n> stall=0
ctrl address=<n> config=1 ep0_state=0 desc=<n> set_addr=1 set_cfg=1
```

Verified host checks:

```sh
./widget-control -a
./widget-control -d
./widget-control -g
./widget-control -m
./widget-control -l
./widget-control -r
system_profiler SPAudioDataType
```

Typical feature output:

```text

```

## Porting Direction

The original AVR32 firmware depends on AVR32-specific ASF components including
USBB, PDCA, TWIM, SSC, FLASHC, and the AVR32 FreeRTOS port. The next practical
SAME70 milestone is moving beyond descriptor/control compatibility: configure
USBHS endpoints 3, 4, and 5 for isochronous traffic, produce safe placeholder
audio/feedback data, then map the original SDR Widget audio pipeline onto
SAME70 peripherals if matching hardware is available. Add real feature storage
in SAME70 flash only if persistence matters for the next test.
